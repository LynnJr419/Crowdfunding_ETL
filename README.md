# Crowdfunding_ETL

## Overview
In this project, the team members practiced building an ETL pipeline using Python and Pandas. The process involves:
1. Data Extraction and Transformation: utilizing Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data
2. CSV File Creation: After transforming the data, generate four CSV files
3. Database Design: Use the CSV data to create an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and a table schema.
4. Data Upload: Finally, upload the CSV data into a Postgres database.
